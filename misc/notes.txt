part1

parser.cup:

you specify the symbols of your grammar (terminal T1,T2; non terminal N1, N2;),
as well as the productions (LHS :== RHS1 | RHS2 ;).
If you provide each production alternative with action code
({: RESULT = myfunction(); :})
the parser will call this action code after performing a reduction with the
particular production.

A CUP specification consists of:

    package and import specifications
    parser class name
    user code components
    symbol (terminal and non-terminal) lists
    precedence declarations
    the grammar



part2

scanner.flex:

UserCode

The first part contains user code that is copied verbatim into the beginning of the source file of the
generated lexer before the scanner class is declared. This is the place to put package declarations
and import statements.


%%

Options and declarations

The second part of the lexical specification contains options to customise your generated lexer,
declarations of lexical states and macro definitions for use in the third section ``Lexical rules'' of the
lexical specification file.


%%

Lexical rules

The ``lexical rules'' section of a JFlex specification contains a set of regular expressions and actions
(Java code) that are executed when the scanner matches the associated regular expression.

CHECK            and calls
CHECK    conditionals (if-else i.e, every "if" must be followed by an "else"),
CHECK    language supports the concatenation (+) operator over strings,
CHECK    and the following logical expressions:
CHECK    is-prefix-of (string1 prefix string2): Whether string1 is a prefix of string2.
CHECK    is-suffix-of (string1 suffix string2): Whether string1 is a suffix of string2.
